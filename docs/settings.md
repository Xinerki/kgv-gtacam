- `sway`: X and Y multipliers for camera sway when aiming a weapon.
- `gforce_mult`: How much to multiply the G-force value for G-force specific effects.
- `pitch_limits`: Camera pitch (up/down) limits.
    - `ONFOOT`/`VEHICLE`:
        - `min`: How far down can the camera point.
        - `max`: How far up cam the camera point.

For each set to true, overwrite the setting with convar setting from the [built-in crosshair](https://docs.fivem.net/docs/client-manual/crosshair/). `c_dot` enabled by default, which then checks for the [cl_crosshairdot](https://docs.fivem.net/docs/client-manual/crosshair/#cl_crosshairdot-bool) convar.
- `cameras`: Table of all the camera modes. Can have as many defined as you wish, must have at least one.
    - `name`: The name of the mode, primarily used for debugging and organizing.
    - Required camera types for a mode:
        - `ONFOOT`: Base on-foot camera.
        - `ONFOOT_HIP`: Hip-firing on-foot (shooting without aiming).
        - `ONFOOT_AIM`: Aiming a weapon on-foot.
        - `VEHICLE`: Base vehicle camera. Values adjust depending on model dimensions.
        - `VEHICLE_DRIVEBY`: Drive-by in a vehicle. Values adjust depending on model dimensions.
    - Camera type settings:
        - `xoffset`: Left/right offset, not relative to the player orientation.
        - `yoffset`: Forward/back offset, relative to the player orientation.
        - `height`: Base camera height. Vehicle camera types automatically adjust based on model dimensions.
        - `distance`: Base camera distance. Vehicle camera types automatically adjust based on model dimensions.
        - `fov`: Base camera FOV. All FOV effects add onto this value.
